# 🛠️ GroomForge v1.1.0 Official Wiki: Blender to Unreal Engine 5.x
---

## Strategy & Pipeline Overview

🎯 **Advanced Pipeline Solution for Professional Grooming**

GroomForge v1.1.0 is a professional pipeline add-on designed to convert and export Blender Hair Curves into assets optimized for the Unreal Engine 5.x Groom system and 5.7 Hair Dataflow. It implements high-end features—previously exclusive to tools like Maya XGen or Houdini—directly within the Blender environment, providing precise guide control and attribute injection.

### 1. Key Overview
- **Precise Data Conversion:** Fully distinguishes and controls Guide (Value: 1) and Strand (Value: 0) attributes as recognized by Unreal Engine.
- **Root Alignment:** Automatically aligns thousands of hair curve roots to the target mesh (scalp) normals to ensure simulation stability.
- **Automated Rigging Pipeline:** Automates everything from hair accessory generation to bone rigging based on guide curves.
- **MetaHuman Compatible Hair Card Engine:** Generates cards faster than the in-engine generator, supporting length-based packing and color-guide UV placement.
- **UE Optimized Export:** Automatically injects essential professional attributes for engine rendering, including Root UV, ClumpID, and Occlusion.

### 2. Prerequisites & Requirements
- **Installation:** `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install` → Select `GroomForge.zip` and enable.
- **Recommended Environment:** Blender 4.x / 5.x, Unreal Engine 5.x (5.7 recommended for latest features).
- **Required Data:** Blender Hair Curves (Native or 3rd-party add-ons), Target Mesh (Character Head Mesh).

!!! warning
    ⚠️ **Important:** GroomForge v1.1.0 is **not** a hair creation tool.  
It is a pipeline add-on designed to **organize, guide-ize, rig, set attributes, and export** existing hair curves for Unreal Engine 5.x.

### 🚀 Cross-Platform Performance Innovation
GroomForge breaks the boundaries of platforms, engineered to provide peak performance across both Windows and Mac (M1/M2/M3) environments. It ensures engine-level stability even when handling massive grooming datasets.

- **Unmatched Speed:** Achieved **1.4x faster processing speed** on Mac compared to Blender's native features. (Based on 1M Strands)
- **Massive Data Scalability:** Proven stability in processing up to **10 million strands (10M Strands)**.
- **Perfect Precision:** Recorded a **Precision Diff of 0.0000000000** on all platforms, guaranteeing absolute data integrity.

## Workflow

1. **Prepare Hair Curves** — Complete styling and apply scale (`Ctrl+A`).
2. **Assign Target Mesh** — Prepare the head mesh where the hair will be attached.
3. **Run Root Align** — Precisely align curve roots based on the target mesh.
4. **Use Guide Setting Tools** — Assign guides and automate node setup via **Fix & Output Connect**.
5. **Verify Guide Color View** — Visually inspect the guide and strand configuration.
6. **(Optional) Create Hair Rig Prop** — Generate guide-based accessories and automated rigging.
7. **(Optional) Utilize Hair Card Engine** — Create UE-compatible high-speed hair cards and UV layouts.
8. **Run Advanced Groom Export** — Inject final rendering attributes via **Add Missing Attributes** and export Alembic.
9. **Apply in Unreal Engine 5.x** — Import and verify the Groom asset (integrate with 5.7 Dataflow if necessary).

## Technical Manual & Features

### 1. How to Install GroomForge
Go to **Edit > Preferences** in the top menu.  
Select the **Add-ons** tab → click **Install...** → select `GroomForge.zip` → click **Install Add-on**.  
Search for “GroomForge” and check the box to enable it.

![Install](assets/Install.gif)

### 2. Root Align: One-Click Root Alignment
Eliminates the tedious task of manually correcting thousands of curve directions and ensures attachment precision in Unreal.

- **How to use:** Select Hair Curves → Pick Target Mesh → Click **Root Align**.
- **Precision:** Automatically identifies the point closest to the mesh and sets it as the Root, preventing simulation errors where hair floats or roots and tips are swapped.

![Root Align](assets/blender_KqxPpDRfo2.gif)  
*Even if the curve's start and end points are swapped, it automatically identifies the point closest to the target mesh (head) to reset the Root and correctly realigns the direction.*

### 3. Guide Setting Tools & Fix Tool (Attribute Protection)
Precisely defines and protects the Guide attributes required by the Unreal Groom system.

- **Guide 1 / 0:** Manually assign/unassign selected curves as Guides.
- **Select 1 / 0:** Quickly select or invert selection of current Guides.
- **Random Guide:** Convert a specific percentage of hair into guides randomly.

![Guide Setting Tools](assets/blender_RPCN1OPj8f.gif)

**🆕 Fix & Output Connect:** Automatically builds the necessary node structure to prevent Guide attributes from “bleeding” into strands within Geometry Nodes.

*When using Blender Hair Add-ons (e.g., HairBRIC, Hair Tool)*

![Fix with Native Nodes](assets/blender_UA91lgEH3p.gif)  
**When using Native Blender Hair Nodes (Geometry Nodes)**

**💡 Pro Tip:** This feature works most intuitively when used in conjunction with the **HairBRIC** add-on.

### 4. Guide Color View (Visual Inspection)
Final visual verification of data configuration before export. (Guides: Red, Strands: Blue)

**When using Native Blender Hair Nodes (Geometry Nodes)**

!!! warning
    ⚠️ **Warning: Viewport vs. Actual Data**  
Due to the nature of Blender's Geometry Nodes, the real-time Viewport display may differ from the actual Exported data. Use Color View for general distribution and flow checks, but always verify the final data within Unreal Engine.

### 5. Guide Protection
This panel provides tools to prevent unintended changes to your Guide data and to inspect the overall data integrity.

![Guide Protection Panel](assets/image%204.png)

- **Fix Guide Count:** Locks the number of currently set Guides.
- **Hair Debug Info:** Displays the current data status of the hair curves.

**💡 Pro Tip:** It is highly recommended to click **Fix Guide Count** after completing all guide setups and executing **Fix & Output Connect**.

### 6. Hair Rig Prop Creator (Automated Rigging Pipeline)
Automates accessory generation and rigging using guide curves as the physical skeleton.

- **🆕 Target Bone Selection:** Allows direct selection of a specific Bone within the armature.
- **🆕 Random Scale:** Randomizes the size of instances for natural visual variation.

### 7. Hair Card Engine (High-Speed Card Generation)
A technical solution to complement the slow generation speeds of the Unreal MetaHuman Hair Card Generator.

- **LOD Compatibility:** Specifically designed to sync perfectly with MetaHuman’s LOD system.
- **UV Color Projection:** Automatically maps card UVs using color-separated data from UE-generated maps.

💡 Professional Optimization Tip: Keep it Lightweight!

To ensure the best performance, especially when dealing with massive datasets (e.g., 1,000,000+ strands), please follow these guidelines:
Recommended Resolution: 256px to 512px.
Why use low resolution?
This tool analyzes spatial regions, not texture detail. Larger images (like 4K) only increase redundant pixel calculations without improving alignment precision.

Using a 256px guide image significantly reduces memory overhead and accelerates processing time, allowing for near-instant UV snapping even with extreme strand counts.

!!! note
    Best Practice: Save your color guide as a low-res PNG to maximize workflow efficiency.
    “Don't waste pixels on calculations. Lower resolution means faster results with zero data loss.”
### 8. Advanced Groom Export (The Core of Attribute Injection)
Converts Blender curves into “True Groom” data that Unreal Engine understands instantly.

- **🆕 Add Missing Attributes:** A single click generates and injects all essential rendering attribute nodes: **ClumpID, Occlusion, Roughness, and Root UV**.

![Advanced Export](assets/blender_OTIdvEWgkU.gif)  
*Select one or multiple hair curves to export them into a single Alembic file.*

## Troubleshooting (FAQ)

- **Q:** Hair direction is flipped in UE. → **A:** Rerun `Root Align` and verify the Target Mesh.
- **Q:** Guide configuration looks awkward. → **A:** Recheck guide weight and node connections in `Guide Setting Tools`.
- **Q:** Attributes are missing after import. → **A:** Ensure you clicked `Add Missing Attributes` before exporting.
- **Q:** Scale or Position issues. → **A:** Verify that `Apply Scale` was performed in Blender.
